We are looking to add multiple feeds from Salsify which is a product management syndication tool. Using their API we want to bring in products that meet certain criteria. Then we would have the ability to pull the fields of woocommerce and map them to the fields from Salsify. The ordering and shipping process would remain in Woocommerce. The only updating that would occur back to Salsify would be inventory updates. This feature will need the ability to turn on or off.
